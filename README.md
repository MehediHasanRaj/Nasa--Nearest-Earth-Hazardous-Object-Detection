# Nasa--Nearest-Earth-Hazardous-Object-Detection
•	A Machine learning and Deep learning based Binary classification project
•	Based on the earth’s nearest objects features, model can predict hazardous or not.
•	Preliminary Analysis, Exploratory Data Analysis, pre-processing and Different types of machine learning model and deep learning models are implemented, also selected the best model.
